# Solving-Nonlinear-Equations

[Nonlinear System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_system) is a system in which the change of the output is not proportional to the change of the input, which can modeled with a set of nonlinear equations. Solving the nonlinear equations can give us the clue of the behavior of a nonlinear system. Most of the time, the system is so complex that we can not solve it analytically but only numerically.

We are going to show how to solve this problem via using MATLAB, Fortran, Python and R.
